current status:

implemented:
Detection of checkerboard
masking of region of interest (manually and via the checkerboard)
computation of trafo s.t. ROI is in x-y-Plane


Todo:
create fullscreen OpenCV image on Beamer
Use normal of plane in trafo computation (should be more robust)
Compute homographie from projector to Plane (via metric position of checkerboard corners)
- Projectionmatrix of kinect given by openni-node


MileStone:
Kinect-Pixel to Beamerpixel: Kinect looks at plane, click on one point and change the corresponding projector-pixel color
(freestyle drawing in the wall :)

- Click: 'select on pixel' (x,y) (in Kinect RGB-Image) -> get corresponding 3d Point, apply trafo (x,y)->(x',y',0) where x' is 
in metric coordinates in the plane. Apply projectionmatrix of Projector (x_p,y_p)
