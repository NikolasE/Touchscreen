Kinect-Touchscreen

The goal of this project is to build a prototype for a large touchscreen 
with a projector and a Kinect (or any similar RGBD-Camera). 
The projector is used to project any input on a flat surface 
(a wall or the floor) and the kinect recognizes the user input. 

The current goal is a proof of concept implementation to show 
that the approach is feasible. 
At the end, the touchscreen should be easy to use, so that 
you don't need to care about the internal processing but can rather
use it like a monitor with multitouch input. 


How to use:
(! Still work in progress and therefore unstable !)
// currently not compiled:
- Use projector are secondary monitor (place it virtually right of your monitor, maybe adapt const CvSize C_proj_size in main.cpp l. 64)
- direct the monitor on a flat surface
- point the kinect at the same surface
- Start the application
- Click on the "view" image. The clicked point will turn red on the surface

// current state:
- Use projector are secondary monitor (place it virtually right of your monitor, maybe adapt const CvSize C_proj_size in main.cpp l. 64)
- direct the monitor on a flat surface
- point the kinect at the same surface
- Start the application
- press any key (not a) to get a new view of the checkerboard, the first image will be used to define the table-plane and
  to compute the Homogeneous between table and projector. For the other views, take a large cardboard so that the checkerboard
  is transformed.
- if you have collected enough images, press 'a' to compute the projectionmatrix of the projector.
